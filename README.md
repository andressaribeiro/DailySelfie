DailySelfie
===========
- [ ] If the user clicks on the camera icon on the ActionBar, the app will open up a picturetaking
app already installed on the device.

- [ ] If the user snaps a picture and accepts it, the picture is returned to the DailySelfie
app and then displayed in some way to the user along with other selfies the user may have already
taken. (ListView)


- [ ] If the user clicks on the small View, then a large view will open up, showing the selfie
in a larger format. Hitting the back button in this case brings the user back to the ListView. 

- [ ] In particular, if the user exits the app and then reopens it, they should have access to all the selfies
saved on their device. You may optionally include some way for the user to delete some or all of their
selfies. 

- [ ] Because the user wants to take selfies periodically over a long period of time, the app
should create and set an Alarm that fires roughly once every two minutes. When one of these alarms fires, a notification area notification should be placed in the notification area.
